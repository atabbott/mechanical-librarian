# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Make public installed-artifact qualification exact-source: build with caches
  disabled from a clean bound revision, validate its archive and `RECORD`, seed
  a new environment from locked dependencies, install the explicit wheel
  without resolution, run the full suite against it, prove wheel-to-install
  payload identity and origin, and run its command outside the checkout.
- Add independent, report-only Open Library evidence for an exact usable ISBN
  family alongside Hardcover. The built-in adapter uses canonical exact
  Search/edition/work requests, a fixed one-request-per-second pace, at most two
  candidates and two covers, and a closed finite rich-evidence allowlist.
- Add adapter-specific `config-v4`, `metadata-report-v6`, and
  `batch-manifest-v2` contracts. Open Library's non-secret operational contact
  is used only in identified requests and excluded from persisted data and
  fingerprints.
- Limit Open Library foreground batches to at most five explicit entries before
  manifest creation or egress, while preserving larger and all-eligible batches
  when that adapter is disabled.

- Add a synthetic, aggregate-only EPUB evidence recoverability audit contract.

- Add the read-only current Audiobookshelf book catalogue with bounded refresh,
  deterministic inspection, and config-v3 schema.
- Correct catalogue refresh retention, empty plural ebook classification,
  path-only EPUB mapping, and safe absent/exact inspection failures.
- Add report-only foreground catalogue evidence-batch preview, immutable
  manifest inspection, and serial execution for explicitly selected or eligible
  EPUB entries.

- Add report-only, source-attributed ABS, EPUB-declared, and bounded Hardcover
  cover evidence. Valid JPEG, PNG, and static WebP inputs produce private
  content-addressed originals and deterministic offline preview artifacts; no
  cover selection or write capability is added.

- Expand the bounded configured Hardcover observation to persist ordered rich
  edition/work field evidence, roles, source scope, and per-local comparisons.
- Preserve each bounded Hardcover candidate's opaque provider-local work
  identity alongside its distinct edition identity.
- Classify every retained ISBN claim as accepted, associated, unrelated,
  invalid, or unresolved using primary-package, separately provenanced
  package/opening, and provider-local work evidence. Secondary and conflicting
  identifiers remain typed and report-only, and exact replay validates the
  derived relationship projection.
- Keep ISBN acceptance claim-local: only explicitly designated package
  primaries are projected as ebook identifiers, while inferred primaries,
  print labels, ambiguous labels, and conflicts remain unresolved unless
  bounded provider-local evidence proves association.
- Keep provider-work ISBN collisions unresolved: an accepted ISBN family is a
  work-association anchor only when it maps to exactly one work within that
  provider, without weakening independent provider evidence.

- Preserve source-spine slot positions for bounded local EPUB rear evidence and
  make exact-ID report reopening non-creating.
- Preserve validated package and opening evidence when the optional bounded
  rear EPUB pass reaches its aggregate resource limit, and expose that bounded
  disposition in the retained report.
- Preserve local EPUB source/DOM evidence order, explicit source capabilities,
  and non-canonical oversized or unsafe sentinel states through report replay.
- Preserve duplicate EPUB occurrences with bounded v2 ordinals.
- Exclude package `bkp` book-producer credits from bibliographic contributors
  while preserving raw package evidence, and recognize a strictly bounded
  paragraph-only `Series Name Book|Volume N[.N]` opening-matter cue.
- Admit standards-valid signed-offset publication date-times from structured
  EPUB package metadata while preserving lexical values and event typing.
- Preserve explicit opening-matter publisher and imprint evidence as distinct
  edition roles through inspection, immutable reports, replay, and comparison.
- Require every 0.5 increment to accept only an absent database or its exact
  current schema. Prior and intermediate schemas are rejected without mutation;
  same-schema exact-ID/current-scope replay remains available, and recovery is a
  clean database plus supported report regeneration.

- Added `metadata-report-v2` local-field evidence: complete ordered field
  states, package/opening evidence, and bounded rear-spine copyright evidence.
  Exact persisted reports can be reopened by report ID without operational
  configuration, credentials, target access, or network access.

- Activated the clean-state 0.4 neutral metadata-evidence runtime. The installed
  package exposes `metadata-report` with required config, database, connection,
  library, item, and file-index inputs, plus configuration-free exact-ID and
  current-scope `metadata-report-get` replay.
- Added explicit named target connections, libraries, read-only mounts, and
  provider connections with per-library provider references and explicit
  enablement.
- Added scoped current-item Audiobookshelf reading, the isolated EPUB inspector,
  one fresh bounded credential-bearing Hardcover metadata request per applicable
  provider, then separately credential-free bounded cover request chains, neutral
  all-candidate title/ISBN claims, exact canonical replay, final target/media
  currentness, and an append-only three-table SQLite report baseline.
- Removed the pre-0.4 inventory, workflow, job, preview, proposal, review,
  retry, cache, migration, and compatibility runtimes and their installed
  commands, schema, fixtures, scripts, and operational documentation.

No tag, release, deployment, or production write authority is created by this
development checkpoint.
